# cs_ftw_notes

Hello, world! This is where I'll keep my notes, and prove to Charles that I know how to use Git because I'll upload notes to GitHub once I'm done. 

I am making a change here to see if my Git pull request works. 

Making a second change to see if Git pull request works. Hope it does!
